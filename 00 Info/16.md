Remote Token Introspection is a mechanism used in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect to validate and retrieve information about
access tokens. This process allows a client application or resource server to query an authorization server for details about
a token, such as its validity, associated scopes, expiration time, and the user it represents.

### Key Features of Remote Token Introspection

1. **Token Validation**: It verifies whether a given token is active and has not been revoked. This is essential for ensuring
   that only valid tokens can access protected resources.

2. **Information Retrieval**: The introspection process can return various metadata about the token, including:

   - **`active`**: Indicates if the token is currently active.
   - **`scope`**: Lists the permissions associated with the token.
   - **`client_id`**: Identifies the client that requested the token.
   - **`user_id` or `username`**: Identifies the user associated with the token.
   - **`exp`**: Provides the expiration time of the token.

3. **Endpoint Specification**: The introspection is typically performed via a dedicated endpoint defined by the authorization
   server, such as `/oauth2/introspect`. Clients must authenticate to access this endpoint.

4. **Response Format**: The response from the introspection endpoint is usually in JSON format, containing key-value pairs
   that describe the token's status and attributes.

### Example Usage

To perform a remote token introspection, a client might send a POST request to the introspection endpoint with the token to
be validated:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://authorization-server.com/oauth2/introspect \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <base64(client_id:client_secret)>' \
  --data 'token=<access_token>'
```

### Advantages of Remote Token Introspection

- **Centralized Validation**: By querying the authorization server, clients can ensure they are always working with
  up-to-date information regarding tokens.
- **Enhanced Security**: It allows for immediate revocation of tokens without requiring clients to manage state or cache data
  locally.

### Considerations

- **Performance Overhead**: Each introspection request introduces latency due to network calls, which can impact performance
  in high-load scenarios.
- **Caching Strategies**: To mitigate performance issues, caching mechanisms can be employed to store results of previous
  introspections for a short period.

In summary, Remote Token Introspection is a vital component in modern authentication frameworks, providing a secure and
efficient way to validate access tokens and manage user sessions in distributed applications.
