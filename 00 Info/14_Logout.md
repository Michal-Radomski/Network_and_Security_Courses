To implement a "logout from all devices" feature in an Express.js application, you would typically follow a strategy that
involves managing user sessions or tokens effectively. Here’s a concise overview of how this can be achieved:

### Steps to Logout from All Devices

1. **Identify User Sessions**: Store user sessions in a database or in-memory store (like Redis) with unique identifiers for
   each session.

2. **Logout Logic**:

   - When a user initiates a logout request, mark all their sessions as invalid in the database.
   - This can be done by updating a `lastLogout` timestamp or setting a `loggedOut` flag for each session associated with the
     user.

3. **Token Management** (if using JWT):
   - If you are using JWTs, you can implement a blacklist mechanism. When the user logs out, add their token to a blacklist
     stored in the database or in-memory store.
   - Any subsequent requests using that token should check against the blacklist and deny access if the token is found.

### Example Implementation

Here’s a simplified example of how you might implement this in an Express.js application:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const session = require("express-session");
const app = express();

// Middleware to manage sessions
app.use(
  session({
    secret: "your_secret_key",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: true,
  })
);

// Mock database to store user sessions
let userSessions = {};

// Route to login (for demonstration purposes)
app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.body.userId;
  req.session.userId = userId;
  userSessions[userId] = userSessions[userId] || [];
  userSessions[userId].push(req.session.id);
  res.send("Logged in");
});

// Route to logout from all devices
app.post("/logout-all", (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.session.userId;

  if (userSessions[userId]) {
    // Invalidate all sessions for the user
    delete userSessions[userId];
  }

  req.session.destroy((err) => {
    if (err) return res.status(500).send("Error logging out");
    res.send("Logged out from all devices");
  });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

### Key Points

- **Session Management**: This example uses an in-memory object (`userSessions`) to track active sessions. In a production
  environment, consider using a database or Redis for persistence.
- **Logout Logic**: The `/logout-all` route deletes all active sessions for the logged-in user when they choose to log out
  from all devices.
- **Security Considerations**: Always ensure that sensitive operations like logout are protected and that session management
  is robust against attacks such as session fixation.

This approach allows users to effectively log out from all devices while maintaining control over their active sessions.
