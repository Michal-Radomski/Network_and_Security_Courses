The **JOSE header** (JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption header) is a crucial component in the JOSE framework, which is
used for securely transferring claims (like authentication information) between parties. The JOSE header contains metadata
about the cryptographic operations that are applied to the data being transmitted, specifically in the context of JSON Web
Signatures (JWS) and JSON Web Encryption (JWE).

## Key Features of JOSE Header

1. **Structure**:

   - The JOSE header is typically a JSON object that includes various parameters that describe how the payload (the actual
     data being secured) should be treated. This can include information about the algorithms used for signing or encrypting
     the data.

2. **Header Parameters**:

   - Common parameters found in the JOSE header include:
     - **`alg`**: Specifies the algorithm used to secure the content (e.g., HMAC, RSA).
     - **`kid`**: Key ID, which identifies the key used for signing or encryption.
     - **`jku`**: JWK Set URL, indicating where to find the public key.
     - **`jwk`**: The JSON Web Key itself.
     - **`x5u`**: X.509 URL, providing a link to an X.509 certificate.

3. **Types of Headers**:

   - The JOSE header can be divided into two types:
     - **Protected Header**: Contains parameters that are integrity protected by the signature or encryption process.
     - **Unprotected Header**: Contains parameters that are not integrity protected and can be freely modified without
       affecting the validity of the signature.

4. **Serialization Formats**:

   - JOSE headers can be serialized in different formats, including:
     - **Compact Serialization**: A space-efficient format that concatenates base64url-encoded segments of the protected
       header, payload, and signature.
     - **JSON Serialization**: A more human-readable format that includes both protected and unprotected headers as part of a
       larger JSON object.

5. **Security Role**:
   - The JOSE header plays a vital role in ensuring that messages are securely signed or encrypted and helps prevent various
     attacks such as replay attacks by including unique identifiers and algorithm specifications.

In summary, the JOSE header is essential for defining how data is secured in applications using JWS and JWE, providing
necessary metadata for cryptographic operations and enhancing overall security in data transmission.
