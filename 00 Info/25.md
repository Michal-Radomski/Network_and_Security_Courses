JSON Web Key (JWK) and JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) are important components in the realm of cryptographic key management,
particularly in the context of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

## **JSON Web Key (JWK)**

A **JSON Web Key (JWK)** is a JSON data structure that represents a single cryptographic key. It contains various properties
that describe the key, such as:

- **Key Type**: Indicates the type of key (e.g., RSA, EC).
- **Key Identifier**: A unique identifier for the key.
- **Algorithm**: The cryptographic algorithm used with the key.
- **Public Key Value**: The actual key material used for verification.

JWKs are primarily used to facilitate the verification of signatures on JWTs, allowing systems to confirm that a JWT was
issued by a trusted source using the corresponding private key[1][4][6].

## **JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)**

A **JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)** is a JSON object that contains a collection of JWKs. It must include a `keys` member, which is
an array of JWKs. JWKS serves as a secure repository for public keys that can be used to validate JWTs issued by an
authorization server. This allows clients to retrieve the appropriate public keys needed for signature verification
dynamically[1][3][5][7].

### **Key Features of JWKS:**

- **Secure Key Exchange**: JWKS provides a standardized way to exchange public keys over the internet.
- **Dynamic Retrieval**: Clients can access JWKS from a well-known endpoint, ensuring they have up-to-date keys for
  verification.
- **Support for Multiple Keys**: JWKS can contain multiple JWKs, accommodating scenarios where keys may rotate or different
  keys are used for different purposes.

In summary, JWK represents an individual cryptographic key, while JWKS is a collection of these keys, facilitating secure and
efficient management of keys in applications that utilize JWTs.
