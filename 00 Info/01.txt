Web security, internet security, and network security are interconnected yet distinct areas within the broader field of cybersecurity. Understanding their differences is crucial for implementing effective protective measures.

## Web Security

**Definition**: Web security focuses on protecting websites and web applications from various threats, including attacks like phishing, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting. Its primary goal is to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of web-based services.

**Key Features**:
- **Firewalls**: Filter malicious traffic.
- **SSL Encryption**: Secures data transmission.
- **User Authentication**: Ensures only authorized users access web resources.

## Internet Security

**Definition**: Internet security encompasses a wider range of protective measures for all online activities, including email communications and online banking. It addresses threats that can affect any activity conducted over the internet.

**Key Features**:
- **Malware Protection**: Defends against malicious software.
- **Phishing Prevention**: Protects users from scams.
- **Network Security Measures**: Includes firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

## Network Security

**Definition**: Network security is a subset of cybersecurity focused specifically on protecting computer networks from internal and external threats. It involves implementing measures to prevent unauthorized access, misuse, or theft of network resources.

**Key Features**:
- **Access Control**: Ensures only authorized users can access network resources.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.
- **Firewalls and VPNs**: Protect data in transit and secure remote access.

| Aspect                | Web Security                                     | Internet Security                               | Network Security                                   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**             | Protects websites and web applications           | Protects all online activities                  | Protects computer networks                         |
| **Focus Areas**       | Website vulnerabilities, user authentication     | Data integrity, malware protection              | Network infrastructure, access control            |
| **Threats Addressed** | Phishing, DDoS attacks                          | Malware, phishing                               | Unauthorized access, cyberattacks                 |

In summary, while web security is concerned with the safety of web applications, internet security covers a broader spectrum of online activities. Network security specifically focuses on safeguarding the underlying infrastructure that supports these activities. Each area plays a vital role in maintaining overall cybersecurity.
