To implement OpenID Connect (OIDC) in a React application with an Express.js backend, you can utilize the
`express-openid-connect` middleware. This middleware facilitates the integration of OIDC by managing authentication flows and
session management. Below are the recommended flows and configurations for your setup.

## Recommended OIDC Flows

1. **Authorization Code Flow**:

   - This is the most secure flow for web applications, particularly when using a backend server. It allows the application
     to exchange an authorization code for an access token and ID token.
   - The `express-openid-connect` package supports this flow by default, which is suitable for your Express.js backend.

2. **Implicit Flow**:
   - While not recommended for new applications due to security concerns, this flow can be used in scenarios where you want
     to directly receive tokens in the browser without a backend exchange.
   - The `express-openid-connect` package can also handle this flow, but it is primarily designed for server-side
     applications.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

You need to install the `express-openid-connect` package in your Express.js backend:

```bash
npm install express-openid-connect
```

### 2. Configure Express Middleware

In your Express application, configure the `express-openid-connect` middleware with your OIDC provider settings:

```javascript
const { auth } = require("express-openid-connect");

const config = {
  issuerBaseURL: "https://YOUR_DOMAIN",
  baseURL: "https://YOUR_APPLICATION_ROOT_URL",
  clientID: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  secret: "LONG_RANDOM_STRING", // Use a secure random string
};

app.use(auth(config));
```

### 3. Define Routes

You can define routes that require authentication. For example:

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Hello ${req.oidc.user.sub}`);
});

app.get("/protected", requiresAuth(), (req, res) => {
  res.send(`This is a protected route, welcome ${req.oidc.user.sub}`);
});
```

### 4. Frontend Integration

In your React application, you can initiate the login process by redirecting users to the login endpoint:

```javascript
const login = () => {
  const loginURL = new URL("/api/auth/login", window.location.origin);
  window.location.href = loginURL.href;
};
```

### 5. Handling Tokens

After successful authentication, you can manage tokens as follows:

- Store tokens in HTTP-only cookies to enhance security.
- Use these tokens to authenticate requests from your React frontend to your Express backend.

### 6. Example of Complete Setup

Hereâ€™s a simplified example of how your Express server might look:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const { auth, requiresAuth } = require("express-openid-connect");

const app = express();

const config = {
  issuerBaseURL: "https://YOUR_DOMAIN",
  baseURL: "https://YOUR_APPLICATION_ROOT_URL",
  clientID: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  secret: "LONG_RANDOM_STRING",
};

app.use(auth(config));

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Hello ${req.oidc.user ? req.oidc.user.sub : "Guest"}`);
});

app.get("/protected", requiresAuth(), (req, res) => {
  res.send(`This is a protected route, welcome ${req.oidc.user.sub}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on http://localhost:3000");
});
```

## Conclusion

Using the `express-openid-connect` middleware allows you to effectively manage authentication in your React and Express.js
applications using OIDC. The Authorization Code Flow is highly recommended for its security features, while the middleware
simplifies the implementation process significantly[1][2][6][7].
