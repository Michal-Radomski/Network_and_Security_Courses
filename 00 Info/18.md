## Overview of JWS and JWE

**JSON Web Signature (JWS)** and **JSON Web Encryption (JWE)** are two types of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that serve different
purposes in securing data. While both are part of the broader JOSE (JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption) framework, they
focus on different aspects of data protection.

## Key Differences

### Purpose

- **JWS** is primarily used for **authentication** and **integrity**. It ensures that the data has not been altered in
  transit and verifies the identity of the sender. JWS does not provide confidentiality; anyone can read the payload.
- **JWE**, on the other hand, is designed for **confidentiality**. It encrypts the payload so that only authorized parties
  can read it while still ensuring integrity and authenticity.

### Structure

- **JWS Structure**:

  - Consists of three parts:
    1. **Header**: Contains metadata about the token, such as the signing algorithm used (e.g., HMAC, RSA).
    2. **Payload**: The actual data being transmitted, which can be any JSON object.
    3. **Signature**: A cryptographic signature that verifies the integrity and authenticity of the payload.

  Example of a JWS in compact serialization:

  ```
  eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
  ```

- **JWE Structure**:

  - Contains five parts:
    1. **Header**: Similar to JWS but includes information about encryption algorithms.
    2. **Encrypted Key**: The symmetric key used for encryption, encrypted with an asymmetric key.
    3. **Initialization Vector**: A nonce used in certain encryption algorithms to ensure uniqueness.
    4. **Ciphertext**: The actual encrypted payload.
    5. **Authentication Tag**: Used to verify that the ciphertext has not been altered.

  Example of a JWE in compact serialization:

  ```
  eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjEifQ.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c.DXo7FzH9Rz8A7D0v
  ```

## Use Cases

- **JWS** is typically used when you need to ensure that a message comes from a trusted source and has not been tampered
  with, such as in OAuth tokens or API authentication.
- **JWE** is used when sensitive information needs to be kept confidential, such as personal data or secure communications
  between parties.

## Conclusion

In summary, JWS provides integrity and authentication without confidentiality, while JWE offers confidentiality along with
integrity and authentication. Understanding these differences is crucial for implementing secure communication protocols
effectively.
